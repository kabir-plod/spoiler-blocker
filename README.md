# Spoiler Blocker
Spoiler blocker is an open-source browser extension that removes Facebook and Twitter posts that contain spoilers on the TV shows you're currently watching.

## Installation
The extension can be installed from the Firefox Add-ons library and Chrome Web Store.

## License
This project is MIT licensed.

## Minimum Viable Product
Blocks Facebook and Twitter posts that contain user-defined 'spoiler' words. For example, a post containing the words 'GoT' and 'Daenerys' may be a spoiler for Game of Thrones. If any of these words are defined as 'spoiler' words, the post will be hidden. See https://youtu.be/7K_C84e6hlI for a video demonstration.
